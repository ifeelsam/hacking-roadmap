Are you someone who's delving into the realm of hacking as a hobby, eager to explore and gain expertise for the sheer thrill of it? If so, then the journey from being a mere novice, often referred to as a "script kiddie," to evolving into a proficient hacker can be facilitated by following the steps outlined below. These steps will direct you towards the necessary resources and knowledge that will help you hone your skills and transform you into a knowledgeable practitioner in the field of hacking.

#### Step 1: Learn the Basics on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/signup?referrer=630a8d48aa25650060a8f62d)
- **Objective:** Build a foundational understanding of hacking concepts and techniques in a guided environment.

## Roadmap for Degree Pursuers

![bigd](https://github.com/Hacking-Notes/Hacker-Roadmap/assets/118412415/6a86723b-7940-42d8-9f0d-284d40214822)

There are numerous strategies available for the degree path, and the one outlined below represents my personal roadmap. It's important to consider that the most efficient strategy for achieving the degree with minimal cost involves completing the majority of the coursework outside of WGU, obtaining credits from those courses, and then enrolling when you're between 50-65% done. Assuring you to finish the degree within one term. This approach minimizes expenses and is the optimal choice in terms of both time and money.
